# Case Study: Cyclistic - Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate

The bike-share company Cyclistic, based in Chicago, offers flexible pricing with single-ride, full-day, and annual passes. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as Casual Riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic Members. Annual members are more profitable, and the goal is to convert casual riders into members through targeted data analysis and marketing strategies. üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The *main objective* of this project is to understand the differences in bike usage between casual riders and members to develop strategies that encourage casual users to become members.

## Key Questions

  -  How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
  -  What factors could motivate casual riders to switch to annual memberships?
  -  How can Cyclistic leverage this data to encourage casual riders to transition to annual memberships?

## Data-Driven Strategy

I will use python to explore key attributes within the dataset, create new features to gain insights into the main questions, and visualize significant attributes and relationships. Additionally, I will include interactive maps to show the most popular geographical locations based on bike user type.

Visualizations and data-driven insights will guide the formulation of targeted marketing strategies to increase annual memberships.

An interactive Tableau report will also be provided to explore the data in greater detail.
